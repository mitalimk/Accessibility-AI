{"text":"A flowchart of data structures shows how different ways of organizing data are related.  Think of it like a map of different containers you can use to store information.  Each container has its own strengths and weaknesses, depending on what you need to do with the data.  The flowchart visually connects these containers, showing how they might be used together or how one type might be better suited for a particular task than another.  For example, it might show how a simple list relates to a more complex tree structure, or how a database table is different from a graph.  The goal is to help you understand the best way to organize your data for a specific problem.\n"}
